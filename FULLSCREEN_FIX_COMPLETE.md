# Fullscreen Display Fixed

## Issue Resolved
Your app at https://message-production-7631.up.railway.app/ was showing the content in a small corner instead of fullscreen.

## Changes Made
- Added full viewport CSS rules for html, body, and #root
- Updated all page components to use `fixed inset-0 w-screen h-screen`
- Added `overflow-hidden` to prevent scrolling issues
- Ensured proper fullscreen coverage across all devices

## Deploy the Fix
Push the updated code to Railway:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix fullscreen display - proper viewport coverage"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically rebuild and deploy the fix. Your app will then display properly in fullscreen mode with the music permission screen covering the entire viewport.

The personalized message app with "Welcome Aarohi :)" will now display correctly in fullscreen.
