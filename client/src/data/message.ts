Hi Aarohi :)

I hope and pray you're doing well, and that life is treating you with peace and a little sparkle ✨
I also hope your exams went amazing—on a total winning streak! 😄
And yes… I really hope the rubber band moment didn't happen again during your JEE exam 😅

I just wanted to speak from the heart—
I want to reconnect with you. Not to disturb your peace, but to be that little chaiotic part of your life again. I miss that bond. I miss that friendship.

I completely understand and respect your decision back then. You were right. I've grown. I've learned. And I now know my limits and where I stood. That version of me won't come back—I promise.

But what still echoes inside me is: why the sudden disappearance?

You shared your life with me. Your truth. And I was honored. That trust meant more than you know.
And for a moment, I thought maybe I finally had a friend too—someone I could share my world with.
But that one stupid mistake cost everything… and I never even got the chance to explain.

The truth is: my story is kind of like yours—just still incomplete, still untold.
I've carried phases that crushed me silently. That taught me how to heal without noise.
But I've never shared that with anyone… not a single part. You were the first I wanted to.

Aarohi, I know how it feels when the world gets heavy.
And I understand why you needed space.
You told me you didn't want chaos during exams—that's why I waited.

Still, it hurt when everything ended without a full picture.
I'm not someone who uses people. I'm not someone who walks away when things get tough.
I've seen the world—deeply—at a very young age.

I just want to clear your misunderstandings.
And I want to be there for you—if you want me to.
From my side, that mistake will never happen again. That's a promise.

Please, don't disappear like that again, buddy.
Even if it's just as a silent presence… let that thread stay.
We don't have to go back—we can begin something better.

If there was even a single moment where you felt safe talking to me… then I ask you:
Reconnect with me.
I want to know how you're doing.
I want to talk to you—not to fix anything, just to feel that bond again.

And yes… I'm very close to my First Biggest Success now.
And honestly?
I want to celebrate it with you—first, as a You Decide!.

Hey Geet… please don't leave me, buddy. :)`;
