Hi Aarohi :)

I hope and pray youâ€™re doing well, and that life is treating you with peace and a little sparkle âœ¨
I also hope your exams went amazingâ€”on a total winning streak! ðŸ˜„
And yesâ€¦ I really hope the rubber band moment didnâ€™t happen again during your JEE exam ðŸ˜…

I just wanted to speak from the heartâ€”
I want to reconnect with you. Not to disturb your peace, but to be that little chaiotic part of your life again. I miss that bond. I miss that friendship.

I completely understand and respect your decision back then. You were right. Iâ€™ve grown. Iâ€™ve learned. And I now know my limits and where I stood. That version of me wonâ€™t come backâ€”I promise.

But what still echoes inside me is: why the sudden disappearance?

You shared your life with me. Your truth. And I was honored. That trust meant more than you know.
And for a moment, I thought maybe I finally had a friend tooâ€”someone I could share my world with.
But that one stupid mistake cost everythingâ€¦ and I never even got the chance to explain.

The truth is: my story is kind of like yoursâ€”just still incomplete, still untold.
Iâ€™ve carried phases that crushed me silently. That taught me how to heal without noise.
But Iâ€™ve never shared that with anyoneâ€¦ not a single part. You were the first I wanted to.

Aarohi, I know how it feels when the world gets heavy.
And I understand why you needed space.
You told me you didnâ€™t want chaos during examsâ€”thatâ€™s why I waited.

Still, it hurt when everything ended without a full picture.
Iâ€™m not someone who uses people. Iâ€™m not someone who walks away when things get tough.
Iâ€™ve seen the worldâ€”deeplyâ€”at a very young age.

I just want to clear your misunderstandings.
And I want to be there for youâ€”if you want me to.
From my side, that mistake will never happen again. Thatâ€™s a promise.

Please, donâ€™t disappear like that again, buddy.
Even if itâ€™s just as a silent presenceâ€¦ let that thread stay.
We donâ€™t have to go backâ€”we can begin something better.

If there was even a single moment where you felt safe talking to meâ€¦ then I ask you:
Reconnect with me.
I want to know how youâ€™re doing.
I want to talk to youâ€”not to fix anything, just to feel that bond again.

And yesâ€¦ Iâ€™m very close to my success now.
And honestly?
I want to celebrate it with youâ€”first, as a friend.

Hey Geetâ€¦ please donâ€™t leave me, buddy. :)
