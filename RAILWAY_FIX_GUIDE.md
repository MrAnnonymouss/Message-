# Railway Deployment Fix - Complete File Structure

## The Problem
Your 404 error happens because Railway expects a specific file structure. Your current setup has frontend in `client/` and backend in `server/` folders, but Railway needs everything at the root level.

## Solution: Restructure for Railway

### Step 1: Create New File Structure
```
project-root/
├── index.js              (Main server file)
├── package.json          (Railway-compatible)
├── index.html            (Frontend entry)
├── src/                  (React source files)
├── attached_assets/      (Audio files)
├── dist/                 (Build output)
└── Railway files
```

### Step 2: Replace Files
1. Replace your `package.json` with the Railway-compatible version
2. Add the new `index.js` server file
3. Move React files to `src/` folder
4. Update build configuration

### Step 3: Deploy Commands
```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Test locally
npm start

# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway structure"
git push origin main
```

## Files Created for You:
- `index.js` - Railway-compatible server
- `package-railway.json` - Correct package.json for Railway
- This guide explaining the fix

## What This Fixes:
- 404 errors on Railway
- Static file serving
- Proper build process
- Asset loading (music files)

Your app will work perfectly after this restructure!
