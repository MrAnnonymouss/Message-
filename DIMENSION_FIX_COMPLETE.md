# FULLSCREEN DIMENSION FIX - COMPLETE

## Issue Fixed
Railway deployment at message-production-43b1.up.railway.app showing content in corner instead of fullscreen.

## Aggressive CSS Fixes Applied
- Added `!important` declarations to force fullscreen
- Fixed viewport meta tag with `user-scalable=no`
- Applied `position: fixed` with `inset: 0` 
- Added inline styles in HTML as fallback
- Force overflow hidden on all elements

## Files Modified
- `src/index.css` - Aggressive fullscreen CSS
- `index.html` - Inline fallback styles + proper viewport
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Fixed positioning classes
- `src/App.tsx` - Music permission screen fullscreen
- `src/pages/MessagePage.tsx` - Message page fullscreen

## Deploy Instructions
1. Push to Railway repository
2. Automatic rebuild will apply all fixes
3. App will display in proper fullscreen
